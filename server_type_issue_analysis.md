# Server Type Recognition Issue - Analysis and Solution

## Problem
The script was not recognizing "APP" as a server type, leading to the question about whether it was looking for a folder named 'server_type'.

## Root Cause
The issue was **not** that the script looks for a folder named 'server_type'. Instead, the problem was that the required folder structure was missing.

## How the Script Actually Works

The `config_diff_tool.py` script expects a specific folder structure:

```
base_path/
├── APP/                    <- Server Type Folder
│   ├── hostname1/          <- Hostname Folder
│   │   ├── *.conf          <- Configuration Files
│   └── hostname2/
│       ├── *.conf
├── DB/                     <- Another Server Type
│   ├── hostname1/
│   │   ├── *.conf
└── WEB/                    <- Additional Server Types
    ├── hostname1/
        ├── *.conf
```

## Code Analysis

In the `find_config_files()` function (lines 68-76), the script:

1. Uses the pattern `base_path/*/*` to find folders
2. Extracts the `hostname` from `os.path.basename(folder_path)` (innermost folder)
3. Extracts the `server_type` from `os.path.basename(os.path.dirname(folder_path))` (parent folder)

```python
# Look for folders in the pattern SERVER_TYPE/hostname
pattern = os.path.join(base_path, "*", "*")
folders = glob.glob(pattern)

for folder_path in folders:
    if os.path.isdir(folder_path):
        # Extract hostname from path (last part)
        hostname = os.path.basename(folder_path)
        server_type = os.path.basename(os.path.dirname(folder_path))
```

## Solution Implemented

1. **Created proper folder structure:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p APP/hostname1 APP/hostname2 DB/hostname1
   ```

2. **Placed configuration files in correct locations:**
   ```bash
   cp sample_file1.conf APP/hostname1/application.conf
   cp sample_file2.conf APP/hostname2/application.conf
   cp sample_file1.conf DB/hostname1/database.conf
   ```

## Test Results

After implementing the proper structure, the script successfully recognized:
- ✅ **APP** as a server type
- ✅ **DB** as a server type
- ✅ Multiple hostnames (hostname1, hostname2)
- ✅ Generated proper matrix with 46 configuration entries

## Key Takeaway

The script does **NOT** look for a folder named 'server_type'. Instead:
- **APP**, **DB**, **WEB**, etc. should be actual folder names (these ARE the server types)
- Each server type folder contains hostname subfolders
- Each hostname folder contains the .conf files for that specific host

The folder names like "APP", "DB", "WEB" themselves represent the server types that the script recognizes.
