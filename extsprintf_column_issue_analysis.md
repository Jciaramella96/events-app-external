# Extsprintf Column Issue Analysis

## Problem Description
The `config_diff_tool.py` script was incorrectly adding an "extsprintf" column to the generated Excel spreadsheet, treating it as a hostname when it should not be included.

## Root Cause Analysis

### What was happening:
1. The script's `find_config_files()` function uses a broad search pattern `base_path/*/*` to discover hostname directories
2. This pattern was inadvertently scanning the `node_modules` directory 
3. It found a `.conf` file at `./node_modules/extsprintf/jsl.node.conf`
4. The script treated `extsprintf` as a valid hostname and created a column for it in the spreadsheet

### Why this happened:
- The original code had no exclusion mechanism for common non-hostname directories
- The search pattern was too broad and included system/dependency directories
- Node.js package `extsprintf` contains a configuration file that matches the `*.conf` pattern

## Solution Implemented

### Code Changes Made:
Modified the `find_config_files()` function in `config_diff_tool.py` to:

1. **Added an exclusion list** of common non-hostname directories:
   ```python
   excluded_dirs = {
       'node_modules', '.git', '__pycache__', '.venv', 'venv', 
       'env', '.env', 'build', 'dist', 'target', 'logs', 'log',
       'tmp', 'temp', '.cache', 'cache'
   }
   ```

2. **Added exclusion logic** to skip both server_type and hostname directories that match the exclusion list:
   ```python
   # Skip excluded directories
   if server_type in excluded_dirs or hostname in excluded_dirs:
       continue
   ```

### Testing Results:
- **Before fix**: Script found 3 hostnames (hostname1, hostname2, extsprintf)
- **After fix**: Script correctly finds only 2 hostnames (hostname1, hostname2)
- The extsprintf column is no longer generated in the Excel output

## Prevention
This fix prevents the issue from recurring by:
- Excluding common development/system directories from hostname scanning
- Providing a comprehensive list of directories that should never be treated as hostnames
- Making the exclusion logic apply to both server type and hostname levels

## Files Modified
- `config_diff_tool.py`: Updated `find_config_files()` function with directory exclusion logic

The fix is now in place and the script will no longer incorrectly include the "extsprintf" column in future runs.
